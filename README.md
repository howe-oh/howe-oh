# Hey!
### I'm Alex, and this page is where the majority of my computing projects will be.

I enjoy experimenting with a variety of tools, languages and applications:
- Node.js 
- Git (*duh*)
- React JS & Native <img alt="React Icon" width="25px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/howe-oh/howe-oh/master/assets/react.png" />
- Python
- Working with social APIs (eg, Discord & Twitter) 
- Processing / p5.js
